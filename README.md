## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

To integrate `Feedbacks` into your Xcode project using Xcode 12, specify it in `File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...`:

```ogdl
https://github.com/Ikloo/Feedbacks.git
```

### CocoaPods:

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate `Feedbacks` into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Feedbacks'
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of dependency managers, you can integrate `Feedbacks` into your project manually. Put `Sources/Feedbacks` folder in your Xcode project. Make sure to enable `Copy items if needed` and `Create groups`.
